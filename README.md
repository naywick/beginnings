The very start of my coding journey
Hello. I'm currently teaching myself how to code. I am on a front end web dev track at the minute, and am learning by following a couple of courses. I started out learning using Rob Percival's "The Complete Web Developer Course 2.0" on Udemy. I have since added Free Code Camp to my syllabus based on recommendations, and a project I am working on that requires completion of some Free Code Camp modules. 
I will be posting my code here as often as I make it. I am aiming to code every day. 
If you have any feedback on any of my code, I would be very glad to hear it! 
Thanks for reading, and have a great day.
